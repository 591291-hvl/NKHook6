# NKHook6
A C# modding API for [BloonsTD6](https://btd6.com/) using MelonLoader, made by [TD Toolbox](https://github.com/TDToolbox)



## What is an API?
API stands for "Application Programming Interface". Basically, its a tool you can use to modify any programs that supports it. NKHook6 is an API for BTD6 and future support will be added for BTD Adventure Time.



## How does it work?
NKHook6 uses [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/) to get the files from the game. Once we have the files we can make mods that "reference" game files, or do things in relation to the game's code. Two of the ways you can do this are by using Reflection or [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/index.html). Harmony is more beginner friendly so we'll be mostly using that. This is done by using the [HarmonyPatch](https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/patching.html) system.
