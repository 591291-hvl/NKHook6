# NKHook6
A Boo and C# modding API for [BloonsTD6](https://btd6.com/) using MelonLoader, made by [TD Toolbox](https://github.com/TDToolbox)



## What is an API?
API stands for "Application Programming Interface". Basically, its a tool you can use to modify any programs that supports it. NKHook6 is an API for BTD6 and future support will be added for BTD Adventure Time.



## How does it work?
NKHook6 uses [MelonLoader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/) to get the files from the game. Once we have the files we can make mods that "reference" game files, or do things in relation to the game's code. Two of the ways you can do this are by using Reflection or [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/index.html). Harmony is more beginner friendly so we'll be mostly using that. This is done by using the [HarmonyPatch](https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/patching.html) system. 



## How to get started?
You'll need to do a few things before you can make your first mod for BTD6/BTDAT. Check out our [Wiki Page](https://github.com/TDToolbox/BTD-Docs/blob/master/Unity%20Engine/MelonLoader/How%20to%20create%20Visual%20Studio%20project.md) to learn how to get started and how to create your first project.



## Making your first mod in C#
After following our getting started [Wiki Page](https://github.com/TDToolbox/BTD-Docs/blob/master/Unity%20Engine/MelonLoader/How%20to%20create%20Visual%20Studio%20project.md) mentioned above, you're ready to make your first mod!


## How do Harmonny Patches work?
One of the ways MelonLoader applies your mods is through Harmony patching. Want to know more about Harmony so you can take full effect of it? Check out our wiki page on it [here](https://github.com/TDToolbox/BTD-Docs/edit/master/Unity%20Engine/MelonLoader/Harmony%20Patching.md)
